# Weather App
A simple and stylish weather application co-authored by @a-well. It has a logo splash screen, a simple design minimalistic design where the colors change depending on the weather and a location selector to the right conceled in a "hamburger menu". Almost any major city can be searched for. 
It is best viewed on mobile, but is also supported on tablet and desktops. 

## The problem
One of the most important aspects when designing the application was to use a mobile-first approach. The design is based upon a given design sketch, which was encoraged to follow. The application is built using JavaScript and a HTML skeleton, the styling is added through CSS and the designs are toggled between using a JavaScript if else function. 

If there was more time, a design feature branch would be added, to change the color depending on time of day (eg, clear night sky/ rainy night etc). An error message when searching for cities that doesn't exist would further more be nice to add.
